# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Report labels now show `name=value` for each argument (`file-mode(mode=755,
  path=…)`) instead of bare values in key order, which read as swapped.
- `archive-extract` re-extracts when the archive at `src` changes, instead of
  skipping because the destination is non-empty. Convergence is now decided by the
  archive's sha256, recorded in a `.shellf-archive-sha256` sentinel under `dst`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Capturing a `template` result now works: `s = template(src, dst)` then
  `if s.changed { … }` resolves instead of halting with `err.undefinedResult`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Run transport commands under `/bin/sh` regardless of the target's login shell, so
  a non-POSIX login shell (nushell, fish) no longer breaks the agent bootstrap.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- SSH authentication via the ssh-agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`): the private key never
  leaves the agent, and an encrypted key works. The inventory `key:` is now an
  optional override, tried before the agent (ADR-0026).

### Changed

- `key:` is no longer required in the inventory; authentication falls back to the
  ssh-agent when it is absent.

### Fixed

- Expand `~` in the inventory `key:` path (and `--known-hosts`), so the documented
  `~/.ssh/…` examples connect instead of failing with `read key: no such file`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-03

First tagged release. shellf provisions targets over SSH via a detached resident
agent that evaluates on the host — "raw shell, but idempotent, previewable, fast."

### Added

- Language: lexer, parser, and evaluator with the `observe`/`apply`/`status` def
  contract, `if`/`else`, error handling (`?`), parse-time `for` loops, and
  `with { }` per-call variable overrides.
- Idempotent execution with a `--check` preview and a `status` mode that reports
  current-vs-desired state per host.
- Templating: `template(src, dst)` with the `@{var}` delimiter, rendered per host
  over inventory variables.
- Secrets: `--secret-file` / `--secret-env` with value-based redaction in all
  output, and a tmpfs workdir that keeps plaintext off the target's persistent disk.
- Modules: directory-package user defs, local imports, and hash-verified remote git
  modules with `shellf.lock` and a content-addressed cache.
- Embedded, self-hosted standard library: apt, docker/compose, systemd, ufw, files,
  users, git-sync, http-check, and more.
- SSH transport with a resident agent (inactivity TTL), host-key verification, and
  per-user agent/workdir scoping.
- Commands: `run`, `status`, `clean`, and `version`.
